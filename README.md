This project is a sophisticated, full-stack solution for managing Inventory Categories and Brands. It delivers a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) management interface, architected with a strict adherence to RESTful API principles.The system is structured as a Single Page Application (SPA), utilizing Angular for a dynamic and responsive user experience. The backend is a robust Node.js/Express.js API, and data persistence is handled by the flexible, document-based MongoDB.Key Functionality: RESTful EndpointsThe application exposes dedicated, resource-based endpoints for both Categories and Brands.OperationResourceHTTP MethodEndpoint (Example)DescriptionCreateCategory / BrandPOST/api/categoriesAdds a new entity.Read AllCategory / BrandGET/api/brandsRetrieves a list of all entities.Read By IDCategory / BrandGET/api/categories/:idFetches a single entity by its unique ID.UpdateCategory / BrandPUT/api/brands/:idFully modifies an existing entity.DeleteCategory / BrandDELETE/api/categories/:idPermanently removes an entity.üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack & Architectural SpecificsThis project employs a modern, high-performance technology stack, leveraging TypeScript across both the client and server for enhanced type safety, maintainability, and code quality.Frontend Technologies (Client - Angular)Key AspectTechnologyTechnical ExpectationVerification in Project FilesFrameworkAngularComponent-based SPA architecture and declarative data binding.@angular/core, @angular/routerLanguageTypeScriptStrongly-typed superset of JavaScript.typescript, tsconfig.app.jsonUI ComponentsAngular MaterialHigh-quality, accessible UI components following Material Design.@angular/material, @angular/cdkUtility StylingTailwind CSSUtility-first CSS for rapid development and custom, responsive layouts.tailwindcss, @tailwindcss/postcssPreprocessorSass (SCSS)Modular, powerful CSS extension for complex styling.src/custom-theme.scss in angular.jsonCLI VersionAngular CLI v20.3.6Manages project builds, serving, and scaffolding."@angular/cli": "^20.3.6"Backend Technologies (Server - Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB)Key AspectTechnologyTechnical ExpectationRuntimeNode.jsAsynchronous, event-driven runtime environment for server-side logic.FrameworkExpress.jsMinimalist and flexible framework for defining RESTful routes and middleware.DatabaseMongoDBNoSQL document database, offering high flexibility and scalability for data models.ORM/ODMMongooseProvides object data modeling for MongoDB, ensuring data structure and validation (Assumed).‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup GuidePrerequisitesEnsure the following tools are installed and accessible on your development machine:Node.js (v18.x or higher recommended)npm (Node Package Manager)MongoDB (A running instance, either local or cloud-hosted)Angular CLI (Install globally: npm install -g @angular/cli)Step 1: Clone the RepositoryClone the project source code using Git:Bashgit clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>
Step 2: Backend Configuration and Setup (Server)Navigate to the server directory and install the necessary dependencies.Bash# Navigate to your server folder (e.g., 'server')
cd server
npm install
Database Configuration (.env file):Create a file named .env in the server/ directory.Add your MongoDB connection string and the desired API port:Code snippet# Example: Local MongoDB connection
MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/inventory_crud_db"

# API Server Port
PORT=3000
Step 3: Frontend Configuration and Setup (Client)Navigate back to the project root (where package.json and angular.json reside) and install the client dependencies.Bash# Assuming client code is in the root directory
cd .. 
npm install
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the ApplicationThe application requires two separate processes to run simultaneously: the Backend API and the Frontend Client.Step 1: Start the Backend API ServerOpen a new terminal window, navigate to the server/ directory, and execute the start command:Bash# Terminal 1 (in server directory)
npm start
# The server will confirm connection to MongoDB and typically listen on: http://localhost:3000/
Step 2: Start the Frontend Angular ClientOpen a second terminal window, navigate to the project root, and launch the Angular development server:Bash# Terminal 2 (in project root/client directory)
ng serve --open
# The client will compile (including Tailwind and Sass) and open in your browser.
# Application will be accessible at: http://localhost:4200/
The Angular client (http://localhost:4200/) will automatically proxy/connect to the running Express API (http://localhost:3000/) to facilitate all Category and Brand management operations.
